# Chatbot with Python Keywords

This chatbot is a console-based interactive assistant that utilizes all **33 Python keywords** in its implementation. It can perform various tasks such as responding to user input, telling jokes, keeping chat history, and even playing a number-guessing game. The chatbot is built using object-oriented programming principles and includes an advanced version with extended functionalities.

## Features

- Greets the user and asks for their name.
- Responds to basic questions and user inputs.
- Tells programming-related jokes.
- Displays the current time.
- Saves chat history to a file.
- Includes an advanced chatbot with memory storage.
- Provides a simple number-guessing game.
- Uses exception handling for input validation.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed (3.x recommended).
2. Save the chatbot script as `chatbot.py`.
3. Run the script in the terminal or command prompt using:
4. Interact with the chatbot by typing messages.
5. Type `exit` to end the chat session.

1. **import** - Imports required modules (random, datetime).
2. **from** - Imports a specific function from a module.
3. **class** - Defines the `Chatbot` and `AdvancedChatbot` classes.
4. **def** - Declares functions and methods.
5. **None** - Used to initialize attributes with no value.
6. **global** - Declares global variables.
7. **return** - Returns values from functions.
8. **with** - Manages file handling in `save_chat()`.
9. **in** - Checks if an item is present in a sequence.
10. **as** - Renames an import (`open as file`).
11. **for** - Iterates over sequences in loops.
12. **if** - Used in conditional checks.
13. **elif** - Handles multiple conditions.
14. **else** - Provides an alternative execution block.
15. **nonlocal** - Used inside nested functions to modify an outer function variable.
16. **del** - Deletes elements from memory.
17. **yield** - Used in `response_generator()` to return generator values.
18. **assert** - Validates conditions in `validate_message()`.
19. **try** - Defines a block to catch exceptions.
20. **raise** - Throws an exception if input is invalid.
21. **except** - Handles exceptions raised in `try` block.
22. **finally** - Executes cleanup code regardless of errors.
23. **is** - Compares identity of objects (`is False`).
24. **False** - Boolean keyword used for validation.
25. **while** - Runs a loop until a condition is met.
26. **True** - Boolean keyword used in infinite loops.
27. **not** - Negates a condition.
28. **continue** - Skips the current iteration of a loop.
29. **break** - Exits a loop immediately.
30. **lambda** - Defines anonymous functions.
